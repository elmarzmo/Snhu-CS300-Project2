What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem involved developing a command-line application in C++ to assist academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU.
The application's purpose was to manage and access course information effectively to aid advisors in guiding students.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first understanding the requirements outlined in the scenario and directions. 
Then, I designed and implemented the application's functionalities using appropriate data structures, including a vector for storing course objects.
Understanding data structures, including vectors, was crucial as it allowed me to efficiently organize, store, and manipulate course information within the application.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One significant roadblock I encountered was in selecting the appropriate data structure for managing the course information efficiently.
After exploring various options and considering factors like access time and memory usage, I ultimately decided to utilize a vector for its dynamic resizing capability and efficient random access operations.
Additionally, I faced challenges with loading data from files into the program.
To overcome this obstacle, I extensively researched online resources, consulted documentation, and experimented with different file input methods. 
Through persistent testing and iteration, I successfully implemented a robust file reading mechanism that effectively loaded course data into the program, enabling seamless functionality.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of modularization, encapsulation, and adherence to best practices, including the effective use of vectors.
I learned to design and implement functionalities in a structured and organized manner, leveraging the capabilities of vectors for dynamic data management.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of writing programs that prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability, including the effective use of vectors.
I adopted industry-standard best practices such as error handling, input validation, and clear commenting.
